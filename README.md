- **Colleges Table**: Stores college information (name, score, city, and state).
- **College Placements Table**: Maintains yearly placement statistics for each college.
- **College-Wise Courses Table**: Contains course details for colleges.
- **Cities and States Tables**: Provide geographical references for colleges.

### **2. API Endpoints**
- **College Placement Data**: Year-wise placement statistics and trends.
- **College Courses**: Retrieve courses offered by a college, sorted by course fees.
- **Filter by City/State**: Fetch colleges based on city or state filters.

### **3. Authentication**
- Implements **JWT-based authentication** for secure access.
- Supports user login and signup functionality.

### **4. CRUD Operations**
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for colleges, placements, and courses.
- Includes robust input validation and error handling.

### **5. Deployment**
- Deployed on **Render** with PostgreSQL.
- Integrated **Swagger** documentation for API exploration.

### **6. Optional Enhancements**
- Pagination for large dataset queries.
- Role-based access control for admin tasks.
